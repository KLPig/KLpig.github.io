# KL Website
## Introduction
This website is *private* [^WHY] as you need a password.

* Don't ask me for the password. for the `visitor` accounts, you may find out in these files. [^FIND_OUT]
* Or, you may find the `guest` by simply typing `guest`, but you can only visit the `secret` .

## Secret

The you can visit these *tools* and *games* as `secret/`, there're two ways to visit `secret/`.

* Use a `special code` which is usually written with **BLOCK LETTERS** and **connected-with-hyphon**. It was called as `search` but definately not. They're something in ***CONTENT*** like the word below.
  > GOOD-THING
[^BANNED]

* Click these thing in the content on the left. [^YNOOB] It'll show you the code, too. Just move your `mouse` and click it.
