## Introduction
This website is *private* [^WHY] as you need a password.

Don't ask me for the password. Just check the `html` doc file.

## Inner introduction

The you can visit these *tools* and *games* as `secret/`, there're two ways to visit `secret/`.

* Use a `special code` which is usually written with **BLOCK LETTERS** and **connected-with-hyphon**. It was called as `search` but definately not. They're something in ***CONTENT*** like the word below.
  > GOOD-THING
* Click these thing in the content on the left.[^YNOOB] It'll show you the code, too. Just move your `mouse` and click it.
